    Obstacles are placed throughout the map of the game randomly by the game server at the beginning of each game. A
    tank cannot move in to an area with an obstacle. Moreover, the tank would lose health if it tries to collide with an
    obstacle. There are 3 types of obstacles.

        <li>A tank cannot move through a brick wall.</li>
        <li>A bullet cannot move through the wall but can damage it by 25% of its initial condition.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
