    Collecting points is the main objective of the tank game. The player with highest points will win at the end of the
    game. Points can be obtained mainly by,
<ul>
    <li>Breaking bricks</li>
    <p>Every bullet hit on brick walls adds 10 points to the tank which shot the bullet.</p>
    <li>Collecting coins</li>
    <p>Collecting coins will add points equivalent to the value of the collected coin pile.</p>
    <li>Spoils of war</li>
    <p>When a tank destroys another tank, the killer will get 25% of the value of the points obtained by the destroyed
        tank.</p>
</ul>
