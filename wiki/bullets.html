    A tank can shoot bullets in the direction in which the tank is directed to. A bullet will travel three times faster
    than a tank until it hits another tank, a brick wall, a stone wall or the end of the map. Bullets can travel over
    water bodies.

<p>
    Upon hitting a tank, it will reduce 10% of the initial health from the tank. If hit on a brick wall, the wall will
    get destroyed by 25%. If the bullet hits a stone wall it will not have any impact on the wall.
